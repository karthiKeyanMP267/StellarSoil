## Integration Points

### 1. App.jsx
- Farmer routes now wrapped with FarmerProfileGuard to enforce profile completion:
```jsx
<Route path="/farmer" element={<FarmerRoute><FarmerProfileGuard><FarmDashboard /></FarmerProfileGuard></FarmerRoute>} />
<Route path="/farmer/profile" element={<FarmerRoute><FarmerProfileGuard><FarmProfile /></FarmerProfileGuard></FarmerRoute>} />
<Route path="/farmer/analytics" element={<FarmerRoute><FarmerProfileGuard><FarmerAnalytics /></FarmerProfileGuard></FarmerRoute>} />
<Route path="/farmer/customers" element={<FarmerRoute><FarmerProfileGuard><FarmerCustomers /></FarmerProfileGuard></FarmerRoute>} />
<Route path="/farmer/deliveries" element={<FarmerRoute><FarmerProfileGuard><FarmerDeliveries /></FarmerProfileGuard></FarmerRoute>} />
```

### 2. FarmDashboard.jsx
- LiveMarketPriceWidget added to the dashboard:
```jsx
{/* Market Price Widget */}
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ delay: 0.15 }}
  className="mb-8"
>
  <LiveMarketPriceWidget />
</motion.div>
```

### 3. API Integration
- Added additional endpoints for ml_service:
  - `/api/ml/crop-list`: Returns available crops for prediction
  - `/api/ml/price-prediction/:crop`: GET endpoint for easier fetching of price predictions
